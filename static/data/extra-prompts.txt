How is your body feeling?
How has this been done before?
Take it further
What don't you want to talk about?
Why?
Use more words
Take five deep breaths
Try again...what are you feeling?
Where are you?
Why is this day different than any other for you?
Laugh
What impulse did you have today that you regret not acting on?
What types of knowledge are you prioritizing?
What are you mirroring now?
Close your eyes
What do you need?
Say it again, more slowly
